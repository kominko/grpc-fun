# GRPC vs HTTP API

There are 4 projects
- GrpcFunServer - .net core grpc server
- HttpApi - .net core http api
- AngularClient - web client
- GrpcFunClient - .net core grpc client

### How to run

- You don't need to run the GrpcFunClient.
- Open GrpcFunServer in VS/Code and run.
- Open HttpApi in VS/Code and run.
- Open AngularClient in VS Code and install deps (`npm i` from terminal)
- run (`ng serve -o` from terminal)
- On the browser, hit F12 and view on the network tab to see the performance.
